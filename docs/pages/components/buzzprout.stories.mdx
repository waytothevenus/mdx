## Help

<Story name="help" />

To embed a Buzzprout podcast episode player using the `<Buzzprout />` component grab the `buzzproutId` and episodeId from the URL.

It should be everything after https://www.buzzsprout.com

```
https://www.buzzsprout.com/1081172/4728410-react-hooks
```

The `buzzproutId` is this bit.

```
1081172/4728410-react-hooks
```

Then use it in the component like this.

```jsx
<Buzzprout buzzproutId="1081172/4728410-react-hooks" />
```
