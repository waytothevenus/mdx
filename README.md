The new home of MDX Embed

Soon-ish the following packages will replace [@pauliescanlon/gatsby-mdx-embed](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-mdx-embed)

## npm

- [mdx-embed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mdx-embed)
- [gatsby-plugin-mdx-embed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-plugin-mdx-embed)

The new goal of MDX Embed is to allow it's use with any MDX Project.

Whilst the existing project could be used outside of a Gatsby environment the name, README and general usage tie it too closely with Gatsby and under the hood it is already pretty much production ready and can work without Gatsby.

The new project splits the Provider from the Gatsby plugin so it can be used anywhere [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx) can be used, e.g [Next.js](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started/next) and [MDX Deck](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck).

For Gatsby users there's a new plugin on the way which will work in exactly the same way as the old one.

Work has begun and we're aiming to be ready for `v1.0.0` in mid September 2020.
