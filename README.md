The new MDX Embed

Soon-ish this will replace [@pauliescanlon/gatsby-mdx-embed](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-mdx-embed)

The new goal of MDX Embed is to allow it's use with any MDX Project. Whilst the existing project could be used outside of a Gatsby environment the name, README and general usage tie it too closely with Gatsby and under the hood it is already pretty much production ready and can work without Gatsby.

## Food for thought

- Mono repo for MDX Embed
- New package for `mdx-embed`
- New package for `gatsby-plugin-mdx-embed`
- Potentially a package for Next, if they have a similar plugin system, else just use `mdx-embed`
